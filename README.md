# Cardio-Divination

# Objective

The Cardio Divination project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model for detecting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a set of clinical and demographic features. The primary goal is to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and prevention by providing a reliable decision-support tool. The project focuses on leveraging Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between patients with and without heart disease.


# Problem Statement

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and treatment. Traditionally, diagnosis relies on clinical expertise and a variety of medical tests, which may not always be accessible or cost-effective. With the availability of patient health datasets containing features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle indicators, machine learning can be employed to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

The challenge lies in accurately modeling the non-linear interactions between clinical variables while minimizing false predictions. A reliable prediction system can support healthcare professionals in risk assessment, preventive care, and personalized treatment planning.


# Solution

Built a predictive machine learning model to identify the likelihood of heart disease using patient health metrics (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate). Utilized the UCI Heart Disease dataset and applied preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, normalization, and feature selection. Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Achieved over 90% accuracy using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Visualized key performance metrics including confusion matrix curve for model validation.


# Insights & Observations

Patients with higher age, cholesterol levels, and resting BP, combined with lower max heart rate and presence of exercise-induced angina, were more likely to be classified as having heart disease.

Feature scaling significantly impacted the performance of the SVM model.

Kernel selection plays a critical role in capturing the non-linear patterns in the dataset.

Support Vector Machines are powerful and flexible, capable of handling complex boundaries and high-dimensional data.

SVM are best suited when accuracy is critical and dataset size is moderate, but can become computationally heavy for very large datasets.


# Future Scope

To further enhance the model and its applicability, the following improvements are recommended:

Incorporate additional patient data to improve model generalization.

Apply advanced feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA.

Experiment with ensemble models combining SVM with tree-based algorithms.

Deploy the model in a web-based application for real-time risk assessment.


# Conclusion

The Cardio Divination project successfully demonstrated the potential of SVM in predicting heart disease from clinical data. The final model achieved strong predictive performance, and with further refinements, it can be integrated into healthcare systems as a supportive diagnostic tool.
